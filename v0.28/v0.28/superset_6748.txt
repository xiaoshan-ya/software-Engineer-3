I encountered the same problem, This is due to lack of packages. you should run command"npm install".

I'm facing this error as well. It seems to be due to the `import()` call. Running a node repl and just entering `import("fs");` it throws an unhandled promise error, which I thought was expected in all versions of node. I'm on v11.11.0

`npm install` didn't fix the issue for me.

Turns out this is due to an issue in webpack ^4.29.0. Reverting to 4.28.2 resolved this issue.

The current `package-lock.json` points to `"version": "4.27.1"`, wondering how you got to this. Did you bump webpack in your fork?
