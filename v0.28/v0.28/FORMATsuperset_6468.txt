Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!  - [x] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any. - [x] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. - [x] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.   ### Superset version 0.28.1  ### Expected results Gamma users should not be able to see databases they do not have access to.  ### Actual results Gamma users can see all the databases.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Create two databases, each with at least a table. 2. Create a new role and user as shown in https://superset.incubator.apache.org/security.html#managing-gamma-per-data-source-access, giving it access to one table only. 3. Log in with the new user. 4. Click on "Sources" -> "Databases".
