Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!

- [x ] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
- [x ] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
- [x ] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.


### Superset version
28

### Expected results
I adjust the date filter and the filter is visible and my entries are applied to the dashboard

### Actual results
The filter becomes blank and I see this in the stack trace if I hit refresh:

Howdy,

Superset is an awesome project! Weâ€™re also experiencing this issue, though, and it's a fairly painful one.

Kind regards,
Ben

I recommend using the latest release candidate while we figure out the ASF release process `pip install superset==0.29.0rc7`

Sorry, I stopped testing SuperSet because of few issue, this one included, so i don't have a test environment available for the moment to recheck. I was planning to test again if i received news through this post that it's fixed...

I'm not really using it much because of the number of frustrating bugs.
