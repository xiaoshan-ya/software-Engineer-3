Hi,

I'm using superset against a MySQL databases, where data are stored in UTC (which is fine).
Clients connections to these databases all have the parameter ?serverTimeZone=XX/YY

I didn't find the equivalent in superset. 

When I tried to add the parameter in SqlAlchemy URI, it told me 'serverTimeZone is an invalid keyword argument'

I've seen #703 which is related but apparently for Druid.


### Superset version

0.28.1

### Expected results

in SQL Editor, run this query against a mysql database is a different timezone :

select now();

get local time as result

### Actual results

UTC time is returned
