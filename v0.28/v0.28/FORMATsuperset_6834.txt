(error: https://example.net/static/assets/dist/vendors-EventFlow-big_number-cal_heatmap-chord-country_map-directed_force-filter_box-heatmap-histogr-4abe76ce.fc10d2b92451bc9dbaf0.chunk.js)  ### Steps to reproduce  Get Superset and run it on port 8088  In `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`, have this at the bottom:  ``` # Apache Superset ProxyPass /superset http://localhost:8088 ProxyPassReverse /superset http://localhost:8088  <Location /superset>         RewriteEngine On     Header edit Location ^https?://([^/]+)/(.*)$ https://$1/superset/$2     RequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding     ProxyHTMLEnable On     ProxyHTMLExtended On     ProxyHTMLURLMap / /superset/     ProxyHTMLURLMap /superset/ /superset/         RewriteBase "/superset/"  </Location> ```

Can confirm that this is still an issue. I have not yet found a way to successfully implement a reverse proxy (nginx, apache or IIS) in front of Superset. Some kind of redirect loop seem to always be formed. 
Same problem here with Superset and Apache HTTP mod_proxy. Over HTTPS the login page not loading correctly. If I access port 8088 everything is correct. In Firefox debug console:  - Strict-Transport-Security warnigs  - MIME type mismatch erros.  Add that I have configured the following but it seems to do nothing:  RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"   
Looking at the original description, it looks like you are attempting to set up Superset at a location other than the root location. Superset does not support changes in its root directory. In order to successfully deploy Superset behind Apache or NGinx, it will need to be mounted at the location `/`. We are currently running Superset successfully in this manner behind NGinx at Preset.

I am still facing this issue, even after running under `/`
