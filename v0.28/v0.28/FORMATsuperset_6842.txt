Then, refresh druid metadata 
This issue can be easily resolved by adding logic to not throw an exception but just a set of warning for those failed Druid Clusters. 
I can help if it is fine with you guys. :)  
For sure, help is always welcomed.

I'm getting same error...I cannot fetch any druid cluster. Any suggestion?
