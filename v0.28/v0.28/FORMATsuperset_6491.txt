Hello, Same operations and same bug for us. It is really breaking as those date filters are widely used  Thx 
Howdy,  Superset is an awesome project! Weâ€™re also experiencing this issue, though, and it's a fairly painful one.  Kind regards, Ben 
I recommend using the latest release candidate while we figure out the ASF release process `pip install superset==0.29.0rc7` 
Thanks, we have the same problem too  Thanks again!  Damir
