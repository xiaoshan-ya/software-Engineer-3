@jmarti15  Have you ever met this problemï¼Ÿ 
no for the moment... i'm sorry  
I encountered the same problem, This is due to lack of packages. you should run command"npm install". 
Write down the solution to the problem. I solved it in the following ways. Thanks to the original author https://blog.csdn.net/zhangwenwu2/article/details/81093968 
I'm facing this error as well. It seems to be due to the `import()` call. Running a node repl and just entering `import("fs");` it throws an unhandled promise error, which I thought was expected in all versions of node. I'm on v11.11.0 
`npm install` didn't fix the issue for me. 
Turns out this is due to an issue in webpack ^4.29.0. Reverting to 4.28.2 resolved this issue. 
The current `package-lock.json` points to `"version": "4.27.1"`, wondering how you got to this. Did you bump webpack in your fork? 
How do you fix the issue ? It didn't work for me ...
