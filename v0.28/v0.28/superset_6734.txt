### Superset version
0.28.1

### Expected results
When I fork git repo and clone into my ubuntu 18, and I follow all the instructions in "Contributing" section "Setup Local Environment for Development", I can see superset loads well and I can navigate the menu, add datasources/tables, create charts and dashboards.

### Actual results
When access Superset in my PC (http://127.0.0.1:8088/) the page loads but without all his CSS or JS, and many of the assets does not load properly (404), and nothing can be done in the app.

Also, I've tried docker solution, but it display many errors and cannot build the docker image.

### Steps to reproduce

I followed the instructions in page "Contributing", section "Setup Local Environment for Development".
In the process some steps failed, and I had to go internet (google/stackoverflow/github-issues) to resolve it.

Adding more information: When I run "npm run dev-server", it outputs a warning:

```
WARNING in ./node_modules/@superset-ui/connection/esm/index.js 1:42-122
"export 'SupersetClientInterface' was not found in './SupersetClient'
 @ ./src/setup/setupClient.js

 @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:9000 (webpack)/hot/dev-server.js babel-polyfill ./src/preamble.js
 ｢wdm｣: Compiled with warnings.

```

I think this could be connected with the errors above.

@leonardo-espinoza can you post all the commands you have run to install and build the front end assets?

Furthermore, are there any errors why you run `yarn install`?

Hi Marcus. Before I answer you, I just discovered that all that problems happen only when I run "npm run dev-server", but when I run "npm run dev" none of that problems happen.

The commands I wrote was:

```
% cd superset/assets
% npm ci
% npm run dev-server
```

There is no `yarn install` in the instructions in "CONTRIBUTING.md".

Thank you.

When using `npm run dev-server`, go to `http://localhost:9000`. 
I have recently updated the instruction to point this more clearly.
