Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!  - [X ] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any. - [X ] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. - [X ] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.   ### Superset version 0.28.1  ### Expected results When I fork git repo and clone into my ubuntu 18, and I follow all the instructions in "Contributing" section "Setup Local Environment for Development", I can see superset loads well and I can navigate the menu, add datasources/tables, create charts and dashboards.  ### Actual results When access Superset in my PC (http://127.0.0.1:8088/) the page loads but without all his CSS or JS, and many of the assets does not load properly (404), and nothing can be done in the app.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1522213/51483218-4ce68400-1d77-11e9-854a-53314df4c23d.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1522213/51483349-9b941e00-1d77-11e9-96df-6342e3237e35.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1522213/51483704-794ed000-1d78-11e9-9447-ac9f32dbfbb0.png)  Also, I've tried docker solution, but it display many errors and cannot build the docker image.  ### Steps to reproduce  I followed the instructions in page "Contributing", section "Setup Local Environment for Development". In the process some steps failed, and I had to go internet (google/stackoverflow/github-issues) to resolve it.   
Adding more information: When I run "npm run dev-server", it outputs a warning:  ``` WARNING in ./node_modules/@superset-ui/connection/esm/index.js 1:42-122 "export 'SupersetClientInterface' was not found in './SupersetClient'  @ ./src/setup/setupClient.js  @ ./src/preamble.js  @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:9000 (webpack)/hot/dev-server.js babel-polyfill ./src/preamble.js  ｢wdm｣: Compiled with warnings.  ```  I think this could be connected with the errors above.  
@leonardo-espinoza can you post all the commands you have run to install and build the front end assets?  Furthermore, are there any errors why you run `yarn install`? 
Hi Marcus. Before I answer you, I just discovered that all that problems happen only when I run "npm run dev-server", but when I run "npm run dev" none of that problems happen.  The commands I wrote was:  ``` % cd superset/assets % npm ci % npm run dev-server ```  There is no `yarn install` in the instructions in "CONTRIBUTING.md".  Thank you.  
When using `npm run dev-server`, go to `http://localhost:9000`.  I have recently updated the instruction to point this more clearly.
