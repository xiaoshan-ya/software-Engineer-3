May be related to similar issue I am getting where clicking an option under "See Table Schema" yields the error: `Error occurred while fetching table metadata`. Upon following the path being called (/superset/table/2/temperature/default/) the error is `{"error": "'Engine' object has no attribute 'connection'"}`. Can't seem to find any stack trace.

Switched to use PyAthenaJDBC and it works. So this might be more of a PyAthena issue, or an integration issue.

Check PyAthena version. [Superset docs](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers) tell `PyAthena>1.2.0` while [PyAthena PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/pyathena/2.5.1/) says `PyAthena[SQLAlchemy]>=1.0.0, <2.0.0`. In my case `PyAthena[SQLAlchemy]>1.2.0, <2.0.0` (combining both constraints) solved an issue and the tables were present in dropdown list in SQL Lab (it was empty with `PyAthena==2.5.1` (latest) version before).
