Hi,  I'm using superset against a MySQL databases, where data are stored in UTC (which is fine). Clients connections to these databases all have the parameter ?serverTimeZone=XX/YY  I didn't find the equivalent in superset.   When I tried to add the parameter in SqlAlchemy URI, it told me 'serverTimeZone is an invalid keyword argument'  I've seen #703 which is related but apparently for Druid.   ### Superset version  0.28.1  ### Expected results  in SQL Editor, run this query against a mysql database is a different timezone :  select now();  get local time as result  ### Actual results  UTC time is returned
