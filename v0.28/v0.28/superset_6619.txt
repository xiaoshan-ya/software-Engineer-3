### Superset version
0.28.1

### Expected results
Time is displayed consistently in the same time zone on the calendar heat map as for the data queried. The January day view should start with the 1st of January for example.

### Actual results
The January day view starts with the 31st of December 23:00 for setups using CET. The data is queried correctly in UTC, but somehow seems to be displayed in local time zone instead.

### Steps to reproduce
- create calendar heatmap
- configure with "day" time grain, "month" domain and "day" subdomain
- observe months starting with the previous months day for time zones east of GTM and all days shifted accordingly
