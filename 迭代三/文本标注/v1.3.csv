72,"### SUMMARY - Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15322 - Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15360 - Improves the header of the filters in the filter bar  Fixes some regressions introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15276: - Fixes the size of the inputs in the modal - Fixes the display of the required message in the modal - Fixes the spacing of the filter items in the filter bar - When the user unchecked the required field, the application unchecked the default value. This is not the intended behavior. - Replaced the required message with an icon in the filter bar - Simplifies the logic of the required checkbox in the modal. If the user checks that a filter has a default value, then the default value is validated.

88,"### SUMMARY When user selects ""Numerical range"" native filter, only numeric columns should be available to choose. If there are no numeric columns in the dataset, show ""No columns found"" message in select column dropdown. When user has selected a non-numeric column and then changes filter type to numerical range, the column field should be reset. We use `type_generic` field to check column's type. If a column doesn't have `type_generic` field, we assume that it's numeric as a failsafe.  Thank you @dpgaspar and @villebro for providing the backend code!  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/123410870-15b3d700-d5b0-11eb-8895-99dd308fc558.mov  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS 0. Enable `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag 1. Create a native filter and select ""Numerical range"" filter 2. Verify that only numeric columns are available to choose from (exception: some datasets from test data, like `message_channels`, have columns with `type_generic` field unset. In those cases, we display them as a failsafe) 3. Change filter type to Value and verify that all columns are available, not only numeric 4.

91,"### SUMMARY When user selects ""Numerical range"" native filter, only numeric columns should be available to choose. If there are no numeric columns in the dataset, show ""No columns found"" message in select column dropdown. When user has selected a non-numeric column and then changes filter type to numerical range, the column field should be reset. We use `type_generic` field to check column's type. If a column doesn't have `type_generic` field, we assume that it's numeric as a failsafe.  Thank you @dpgaspar and @villebro for providing the backend code!  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/123410870-15b3d700-d5b0-11eb-8895-99dd308fc558.mov  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS 0. Enable `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag 1. Create a native filter and select ""Numerical range"" filter 2. Verify that only numeric columns are available to choose from (exception: some datasets from test data, like `message_channels`, have columns with `type_generic` field unset. In those cases, we display them as a failsafe) 3. Change filter type to Value and verify that all columns are available, not only numeric 4. Select some non-numeric column and change back to numerical range - column field should be reset. 5.  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [x] Has associated issue: closes #15226  - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  ",-1

141,"@kicaak Kasia, we need some help on redesigning the cascading filter. a recent change removed the indentation that represents parent and children relationship to preserve horizontal space of the modal. All layers of parent-children filters are stack vertically. Would love to hear your inputðŸ™   cc @kgabryje  ",1
142,"@junlincc Sure! I have an initial idea, it's quite hard to do it without using the visual representation of the parent - children relationship, but I hope I will be able to help ðŸ¤ž I have a few questions/comments about how it works now too.   **Current behaviour** ![Screen-Recording-2021-07-23-at-16 09 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126809118-711f507c-d671-4420-964b-95edef4552f7.gif) I have one parent and one child filter. When I open the popover and select one value in the parent filter not only I am not able to go back to the initial popover state (I need to close it and reopen it), but also on the left the field where before was ""parent"" filter got switched to child filter which is empty. So I kind of had no idea which filter I was editing. This was super confusing to me, is it the expected behaviour?   **Initial exploration**  I tried out a few things and for now I am thinking about adding labels with the name of the parent filter (designs and copy are quite rough now, but wanted to share the concept). This would at least a little bit indicate what this filter is related to, also added a little indentation of the children's children filters etc, not sure about it yet.  ![collapsed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126800625-9d59bc58-f3f8-4884-adc8-52f90150f88e.png) ![expanded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126800631-427677a9-8140-4eb1-83b9-a9b04ec1a81e.png)  I added collapsing/expanding of the children. It can be used in the popover, but I thought it could be more intuitive to add it in the left navigation with all of the filters. You can play the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/jxQD12WvnW63PTK7UFeNzr/Preset_KZ?page-id=2%3A4&node-id=5%3A1214&viewport=-2508%2C-264%2C0.23226340115070343&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=5%3A1214).

I added a tooltip as I think it makes it more clear what this pill refers to.  ![filterpopover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126797776-8d5480ba-b89a-4143-817a-a6ee1405a8f5.gif)  Let me know what you think ðŸ˜Œ   **Improvement**  I thought that the filers and filter groups can take a long time to create by the user, so maybe it would be nice to let them set some filters/groups to active/not active when applying them?   _Use case:_ I have four group of filters which are quite extensive. All of them work at the same time well, but for some reason I would like to see results only from two groups and right now to do it, I think I would have to remove other two.   _Solution:_ I set two groups to _not active_ and run the filters with ""Apply"" button. When it comes to the design - I was thinking about the visual indicator of the active/inactive group or filter. Icon could be placed next to the main parent (single filter, master parent) and that would be enough. This could be for example the icon that now triggers the popover.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126796769-a29abcdc-bd26-48af-a823-effd0e9b7064.png)  ",1
143,"@kicaak Thank you for your examples. I like the idea of opening the filter hierarchy in the filter bar. After all, the user is just setting filter values just like he does when interacting with non-hierarchical filters. The modal approach has problems especially when we have the scroll bar enabled and the filter that the user is currently editing disappears from the viewport. I also think that it's way easier for the user to edit some value in the middle of the hierarchy because currently, only one level is present in the filter bar. If we are going this way, I think we need a more clear distinction of the hierarchy group when it's expanded. Maybe a blue background color or a highlight border or other fancy way.  One problem that we need to figure out is about the value that represents the hierarchy when collapsed. Currently, it changes depending on which levels are already filled and this brings the confusion that you mentioned.  @junlincc I think it would be nice to move this discussion to a separate issue also so that we can refer to it when coding. ",-1
144,"@michael-s-molina thanks for the feedback! ðŸ˜Œ   > One problem that we need to figure out is about the value that represents the hierarchy when collapsed. Currently, it changes depending on which levels are already filled and this brings the confusion that you mentioned.  Regarding this one - I think that parent filter should always be displayed when the hierarchy is collapsed, because otherwise it is hard to follow what happens. We can add a label or other indicator so the user knows that there are fields that are empty. cc: @junlincc what do you think?   > I think we need a more clear distinction of the hierarchy group when it's expanded. Maybe a blue background color or a highlight border or other fancy way.  Agreed, for now I added a divider, but I think it won't work in the long run. The only reasonable solution here is background colour when hierarchy is expanded, but I would not like to use the blueish preset's colour (even if ligter version) as this one should be for special actions/components. Grey may blend with the dashboard, but I will see what else I can do. Also additional thing would be setting up a rule that only one group can be expanded at a time which would help I think.  ",1

148,"@kicaak Kasia, we need some help on redesigning the cascading filter. a recent change removed the indentation that represents parent and children relationship to preserve horizontal space of the modal. All layers of parent-children filters are stack vertically. Would love to hear your inputðŸ™   cc @kgabryje  ",1
149,"@junlincc Sure! I have an initial idea, it's quite hard to do it without using the visual representation of the parent - children relationship, but I hope I will be able to help ðŸ¤ž I have a few questions/comments about how it works now too.   **Current behaviour** ![Screen-Recording-2021-07-23-at-16 09 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126809118-711f507c-d671-4420-964b-95edef4552f7.gif) I have one parent and one child filter. When I open the popover and select one value in the parent filter not only I am not able to go back to the initial popover state (I need to close it and reopen it), but also on the left the field where before was ""parent"" filter got switched to child filter which is empty. So I kind of had no idea which filter I was editing. This was super confusing to me, is it the expected behaviour?   **Initial exploration**  I tried out a few things and for now I am thinking about adding labels with the name of the parent filter (designs and copy are quite rough now, but wanted to share the concept). This would at least a little bit indicate what this filter is related to, also added a little indentation of the children's children filters etc, not sure about it yet.  ![collapsed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126800625-9d59bc58-f3f8-4884-adc8-52f90150f88e.png) ![expanded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126800631-427677a9-8140-4eb1-83b9-a9b04ec1a81e.png)  I added collapsing/expanding of the children. It can be used in the popover, but I thought it could be more intuitive to add it in the left navigation with all of the filters. You can play the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/jxQD12WvnW63PTK7UFeNzr/Preset_KZ?page-id=2%3A4&node-id=5%3A1214&viewport=-2508%2C-264%2C0.23226340115070343&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=5%3A1214).

I added a tooltip as I think it makes it more clear what this pill refers to.  ![filterpopover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126797776-8d5480ba-b89a-4143-817a-a6ee1405a8f5.gif)  Let me know what you think ðŸ˜Œ   **Improvement**  I thought that the filers and filter groups can take a long time to create by the user, so maybe it would be nice to let them set some filters/groups to active/not active when applying them?   _Use case:_ I have four group of filters which are quite extensive. All of them work at the same time well, but for some reason I would like to see results only from two groups and right now to do it, I think I would have to remove other two.   _Solution:_ I set two groups to _not active_ and run the filters with ""Apply"" button. When it comes to the design - I was thinking about the visual indicator of the active/inactive group or filter. Icon could be placed next to the main parent (single filter, master parent) and that would be enough. This could be for example the icon that now triggers the popover.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36897697/126796769-a29abcdc-bd26-48af-a823-effd0e9b7064.png)  ",1
150,"@kicaak Thank you for your examples. I like the idea of opening the filter hierarchy in the filter bar. After all, the user is just setting filter values just like he does when interacting with non-hierarchical filters. The modal approach has problems especially when we have the scroll bar enabled and the filter that the user is currently editing disappears from the viewport. I also think that it's way easier for the user to edit some value in the middle of the hierarchy because currently, only one level is present in the filter bar. If we are going this way, I think we need a more clear distinction of the hierarchy group when it's expanded. Maybe a blue background color or a highlight border or other fancy way.  One problem that we need to figure out is about the value that represents the hierarchy when collapsed. Currently, it changes depending on which levels are already filled and this brings the confusion that you mentioned.  @junlincc I think it would be nice to move this discussion to a separate issue also so that we can refer to it when coding. ",-1
151,"@michael-s-molina thanks for the feedback! ðŸ˜Œ   > One problem that we need to figure out is about the value that represents the hierarchy when collapsed. Currently, it changes depending on which levels are already filled and this brings the confusion that you mentioned.  Regarding this one - I think that parent filter should always be displayed when the hierarchy is collapsed, because otherwise it is hard to follow what happens. We can add a label or other indicator so the user knows that there are fields that are empty. cc: @junlincc what do you think?   > I think we need a more clear distinction of the hierarchy group when it's expanded. Maybe a blue background color or a highlight border or other fancy way.  Agreed, for now I added a divider, but I think it won't work in the long run. The only reasonable solution here is background colour when hierarchy is expanded, but I would not like to use the blueish preset's colour (even if ligter version) as this one should be for special actions/components. Grey may blend with the dashboard, but I will see what else I can do. Also additional thing would be setting up a rule that only one group can be expanded at a time which would help I think.  ",1

162,"In 1.3 branch, when you click on ""Export Dashboard"", the app loads interminably and never downloads the JSON.  This functionality worked in 1.2.

211,"@geido @rusackas @junlincc   > I have noticed a problem with the creation of new options.

I think this used to work consistently with the single mode ON and allowNewOptions OFF, where the selected option is highlighted at top of the options list >   After investigation, I discovered that these were not bugs in the new `Select` component but problems in the `SelectFilterPlugin` component.  `SelectFilterPlugin` contained duplicated logic already present in the `Select` component.

287,When a dashboard is exported not all the associated datasets are exported.  The datasets used by all the charts are exported but the datasets used only in native filters are missing in the exported zip file.   ### Expected results  The dashboard export should contain all the datasets used in the dashboard including the datasets used by native filters.   ### Actual results  The dashboard export contains the datasets used by the charts but is missing the datasets that are used only by native filters.  #### How to reproduce the bug  1. Go to a dashboard that uses native filters and has some charts. The native filters must use a dataset that is not used by any of the other charts 2. Export the dashboard 3. Unzip the exported zip file 4. Expand the datasets directory and notice that the datasets used by the charts are present but the dataset used by the filters are missing   ### Environment  - superset version: 1.3 branch - Python version: Python 3.7.9 - node.js version: 14  ### Checklist  Make sure to follow these steps before submitting your issue - thank you!  - [x] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any. - [x] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. - [x] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.   ,1

296,"### SUMMARY <!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions --> This PR fix CR notes for native filters from here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15506#issuecomment-875420917  1. Remove error message in required filters in filter bar 2. Fix bug when reopens FiltersConfigModal with existed value it's not marked as checked   https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56388545/124783840-076d9f80-df4e-11eb-90c5-f49bfb9e19aa.mov    3. On the way fix Range filter that doesn't apply default value in next flow: a. Create Select Filter b. Switch it's type to Range Filter  4. Removes reset form functionality because of 2 reasons: a. When form saved or closed now it destroys Ant form, so no need reset it b. It applies reset before form closed, and it can mess some form fields before it closed  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable -->  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

425,"### SUMMARY Fixes a bug where some tabs couldn't be deleted due to native filters that point to no-longer existing charts within the tab.  This PR fixes the acute issue, but there's room for improvement! Whenever a chart is removed, we should 1) confirm that no filter is scoped to that missing chart any longer. 2) (optional) if the filter no longer has ANY charts within scope, we could ask the user if they want to delete it.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable --> Before: ![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125387559-5d31b580-e35b-11eb-82a7-eb54af3fa94f.gif)  After: ![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125387575-628f0000-e35b-11eb-9f80-5a17ed4a6c87.gif)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? --> To repro the issue (prior to this PR):  1) Make a dashboard 2) Add tabs 3) Add a chart to a tab (I just used a table) 4) Add a native filter scoped to that chart. 5) (Problem 1) Try to delete the tab containing the chart with the scoped filter. You get an ugly error. 6) Remove the chart with the scoped filter, optionally saving the dash 7) (Problem 2) Try to delete the tab again. Even with the chart gone, you still can't remove the tab.  With this PR, you should be able to remove the tab _with or without_ the chart.  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [ ] Has associated issue: - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  ",-1
426,"@kgabryje if you keep a personal ""rainy day"" backlog, you might be a good candidate to fix the root cause... the filter _seems_ to still be scoped to a deleted chart. That's probably not good in the long run, but doesn't seem to be a _problem_ for now. ",1

437,"### SUMMARY Fixes a bug where some tabs couldn't be deleted due to native filters that point to no-longer existing charts within the tab.  This PR fixes the acute issue, but there's room for improvement! Whenever a chart is removed, we should 1) confirm that no filter is scoped to that missing chart any longer. 2) (optional) if the filter no longer has ANY charts within scope, we could ask the user if they want to delete it.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable --> Before: ![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125387559-5d31b580-e35b-11eb-82a7-eb54af3fa94f.gif)  After: ![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125387575-628f0000-e35b-11eb-9f80-5a17ed4a6c87.gif)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? --> To repro the issue (prior to this PR):  1) Make a dashboard 2) Add tabs 3) Add a chart to a tab (I just used a table) 4) Add a native filter scoped to that chart. 5) (Problem 1) Try to delete the tab containing the chart with the scoped filter. You get an ugly error. 6) Remove the chart with the scoped filter, optionally saving the dash 7) (Problem 2) Try to delete the tab again. Even with the chart gone, you still can't remove the tab.  With this PR, you should be able to remove the tab _with or without_ the chart.  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [ ] Has associated issue: - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  ",-1
438,"@kgabryje if you keep a personal ""rainy day"" backlog, you might be a good candidate to fix the root cause... the filter _seems_ to still be scoped to a deleted chart. That's probably not good in the long run, but doesn't seem to be a _problem_ for now. ",1

448,"### SUMMARY This PR implements conditional formatting component, which is going to be added to Pivot Table v2 and Table charts. Features: - 10 comparator functions (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=, < x <, <= x <, < x <=, <= x <=) - 3 color schemes (green, yellow and red). Alpha channel is calculated dynamically based on a field's value compared to extreme values in data array used to construct the chart and selected comparator. For example, if we create a formatter ""if count > 10 then green"", values close to 10 will be light green (with low alpha) and values close to the largest value in table will be darker green. On the other hand, if we create a formatter ""if count < 0 then red"", values close to 0 will be light red and values close to the smallest negative value in table will be darker red. - can add multiple formatters to a single column (e.g. ""if count < 10 then red"" and ""if count > 20 then green"") - values validation for ""between"" comparators - left value must be smaller than the right value - Column, Colour scheme and Operator have preselected default values when creating a new formatter (default is the first available option)  This PR does NOT add conditional formatting to any chart - it's a prerequisite for follow up PRs to superset-ui repo, which will add conditional formatting to Table and Pivot Table v2 charts.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/125460470-92dc04fd-39b7-4e5f-9c26-b08a8e1acdf1.mov  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS Testing instructions to be added to follow up PRs in superset-ui  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [ ] Has associated issue: - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  CC: @junlincc @rusackas @michael-s-molina  ",1

Currently the Dashboard page will wait for both `datasets` and `charts` data to start rendering, however the datasets data are only used in filter indicators and filter boxes and should not block us from rendering other charts. In our case, the `datasets` endpoint is often much slower because we have a giant single-source-of-truth datasource with thousands of metrics and columns.  Unblocking rendering from the datasets endpoint should speed up the page rendering a little bit. In our use case, it's often a matter of a full second.

Time Column and Granularity control in filter boxes may not have select choices. Filter indicators may show inexplicable filter values. But those are expected to be temporary and not very noticeable.  In case datasets loading fails, in previous case, the whole page won't render, while after this change you still have a largely functional Dashboard page. ",-1

476,"> Have we verified yet that none of the chart plugins use datasets? If so we should also stop passing datasets to the charts.  Thanks for pointing this out. I did more vetting and realized that some charts do use info on `datasource`, mostly non-critical info such as column name `verboseMap` here: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/61accc6ce9c546331b7407cde21d6ec163fe191d/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-pivot-table/src/transformProps.js  Fixed a re-render issue now that charts will be updated accordingly once datasets are loaded:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/125838954-c30b276b-24e2-4612-97c8-60d97f931065.mp4  Notice the name of the first column. It uses `verbose_map` and updated after `/datasets` is fully loaded. Note that I artificially slowed down the `/datasets` API. For most users, this minor update may not be even noticeable.    ",-1

Time Column and Granularity control in filter boxes may not have select choices. Filter indicators may show inexplicable filter values. But those are expected to be temporary and not very noticeable.  In case datasets loading fails, in previous case, the whole page won't render, while after this change you still have a largely functional Dashboard page. ",-1

483,"> Have we verified yet that none of the chart plugins use datasets? If so we should also stop passing datasets to the charts.  Thanks for pointing this out. I did more vetting and realized that some charts do use info on `datasource`, mostly non-critical info such as column name `verboseMap` here: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/61accc6ce9c546331b7407cde21d6ec163fe191d/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-pivot-table/src/transformProps.js  Fixed a re-render issue now that charts will be updated accordingly once datasets are loaded:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/125838954-c30b276b-24e2-4612-97c8-60d97f931065.mp4  Notice the name of the first column. It uses `verbose_map` and updated after `/datasets` is fully loaded. Note that I artificially slowed down the `/datasets` API. For most users, this minor update may not be even noticeable.    ",-1

Fixing the code in FilterBox that is causing the JS error 2. Introduce a `PLACEHOLDER_DATASOURCE` for all chart renderers so similar JS errors will not happen for other charts which forgot to handle the case when `datasource` is not loaded. 3. Don't render JS errors when chart's `datasource` is `PLACEHOLDER_DATASOURCE`. After the API is successfully returned, chart reducer will trigger a re-render.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF  #### Before  See above  #### After  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/127717159-5c53c35d-42ee-48e2-899b-c32a5edf0ecf.mp4  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS  1.

539,"### SUMMARY This PR fixes native filter metadata in versioned import/export of dashboards by doing the following: - export all datasets referenced in native filters, even those not referenced by charts in dashboard. - replaces `datasetId` with `datasetUuid` in native filter targets to ensure that dataset reference is based on UUID, not numeric id.  Other bycatch fixes that were found while testing: - Fix datatype of `query_context` in `ImportV1ChartSchema`, which should be `String`, not `Dict` (caused a marshmallow schema validation exception). Also make it accept `None` values and add JSON validation. - `datasource_type` in `dataset_info` was set as `view` if the table was a virtual table, which caused an exception when importing virtual datasets. Since virtual datasets are in fact regular `table` datasources, we just reference the `datasource_type` of the imported dataset.  ### SCREENSHOT Now native filter targets are referencing `datasetUuid` instead of `datasetId`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/127825419-d0e82a8e-19c3-4afa-87c0-77ee4bd2f4ce.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS  1. enable the ""VERSIONED_EXPORT"" feature flag 2. export a dashboard that had only one chart and two native filters, one referencing the same dataset as the chart and another not referenced by the chart 3. check that the native filter configurations in the dashboard metadata contain `datasetUuid` instead of `datasetId` references 4. delete the exported dashboard, chart and dataset only referenced by the native filter 5. import the exported bundle 6. make sure the imported dashboard works correctly, and that both datasets are imported correctly and native filter configurations are correct  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [x] Has associated issue: closes #15484 , closes #15531 - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  ",1

In addition a db migration migrates heatmap coloring from the previous version of the Pivot Table V2 chart to the new conditional formatting control.

While this does not provide a 1-1 feature mapping to the previous version of the plugin, it's the closest match that is possible to be achieved with the new formatting control.

628,"### SUMMARY This pr fixes an issue where user would view charts and run queries without saving but the api would return that user had modified the chart. This was caused because of a change in the api using query_context where accessing the slice table would do an automatic saved changed_on_delta_humanize. This pr add two new cols to the Slice table so that the user only see's actually modified charts.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF before:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17326228/128384423-36b496e7-cd96-4b39-b4da-775ecb814fef.mov  after   https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17326228/128393886-6ce5f8d3-4975-4fe1-bfd4-03a69d6df276.mov      ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

631,@pkdotson Maybe I missed some details. I'm curious as to why a get method would modify the metadata? Should we avoid this operation?

633,"@zhaoyongjie I'm not sure exactly where it happens either, but one of @betodealmeida's changes started saving `query_context`. It's not unheard of for `GET` requests to involve db writes, when the server wants to save some aspect of a request or lazily calculate and then save a value, so I think it's okay.  The main thing here is that the value being used for ""last modified"" in the UI should not be something that auto-updates when a database row is written. This PR makes it more explicit. ",-1

This feels somewhat akin to the [There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Was_an_Old_Lady_Who_Swallowed_a_Fly) rhyme.  @john-bodley I added a change where the **first time** the user views a saved chart it does a `PUT` request storing the associated `query_context` in a new column (`slices.query_context`). This is needed because:  1. To get the data for a given chart, we need to `POST` the `query_context` to `/api/v1/chart/`. 2. To obtain `query_context` from `form_data` we need to run Javascript code unique to each visualization.  This means that, programmatically, **it was impossible to get the data for a given saved chart**, something we needed for reports.  We can't populate the new column `slices.query_context` with the migration script that added, since it requires Javascript code, so the charts now check to see if the column is null, and if so, they will do the `PUT` request to populate the column.  The side-effect of this is that charts are being shown as modified, even if they're not. The problem here is that the `changed_on` column is auto-populated by FAB every time the model changes, and we can't control that from Superset (please correct me if I'm wrong). Which is why @pkdotson added a custom column to track actual modifications by the user, and not by background processes.  Personally I don't see this as an anti-pattern. FAB offers a column `changed_on` for convenience, and if we need finer control I think it's ok to add a new column and track the updates ourselves. This has the potential to be useful for other use cases in the future, like migrations that modify the chart data.  I hope this clarifies things, and makes the solution more acceptable. ",1
642,"@betodealmeida I don't have much context on the query context change, but when I read, the following,  > To get the data for a given chart, we need to POST the query_context to /api/v1/chart/  i.e., a `GET` request first requires a `POST` (to I gather the same table) I just wanted to check that we're confident in the pattern that's being used. Per _this_ PR it feels like _that_ change is snowballing and resulted in unforeseen behavior and thus thought there was merit in confirming that collectively the community was onboard with this approach.

647,@pkdotson Maybe I missed some details. I'm curious as to why a get method would modify the metadata? Should we avoid this operation?

649,"@zhaoyongjie I'm not sure exactly where it happens either, but one of @betodealmeida's changes started saving `query_context`. It's not unheard of for `GET` requests to involve db writes, when the server wants to save some aspect of a request or lazily calculate and then save a value, so I think it's okay.  The main thing here is that the value being used for ""last modified"" in the UI should not be something that auto-updates when a database row is written. This PR makes it more explicit. ",-1

This feels somewhat akin to the [There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Was_an_Old_Lady_Who_Swallowed_a_Fly) rhyme.  @john-bodley I added a change where the **first time** the user views a saved chart it does a `PUT` request storing the associated `query_context` in a new column (`slices.query_context`). This is needed because:  1. To get the data for a given chart, we need to `POST` the `query_context` to `/api/v1/chart/`. 2. To obtain `query_context` from `form_data` we need to run Javascript code unique to each visualization.  This means that, programmatically, **it was impossible to get the data for a given saved chart**, something we needed for reports.  We can't populate the new column `slices.query_context` with the migration script that added, since it requires Javascript code, so the charts now check to see if the column is null, and if so, they will do the `PUT` request to populate the column.  The side-effect of this is that charts are being shown as modified, even if they're not. The problem here is that the `changed_on` column is auto-populated by FAB every time the model changes, and we can't control that from Superset (please correct me if I'm wrong). Which is why @pkdotson added a custom column to track actual modifications by the user, and not by background processes.  Personally I don't see this as an anti-pattern. FAB offers a column `changed_on` for convenience, and if we need finer control I think it's ok to add a new column and track the updates ourselves. This has the potential to be useful for other use cases in the future, like migrations that modify the chart data.  I hope this clarifies things, and makes the solution more acceptable. ",1
658,"@betodealmeida I don't have much context on the query context change, but when I read, the following,  > To get the data for a given chart, we need to POST the query_context to /api/v1/chart/  i.e., a `GET` request first requires a `POST` (to I gather the same table) I just wanted to check that we're confident in the pattern that's being used. Per _this_ PR it feels like _that_ change is snowballing and resulted in unforeseen behavior and thus thought there was merit in confirming that collectively the community was onboard with this approach.

797,"Looking good! And approving! I made one more comment about a const, and also noticed this little issue, which could be tackled in a separate PR or this one (since the issue is ALMOST fixed by this PR):  As you can barely see in this GIF, when changing tabs, the loading state looks great, but goes higher up very briefly because the row containing the tabs very briefly disappears from the layout when switching tabs. If that disappearance can be solved, so it just changes without ""blinking"" we should be in awesome shape! Again, maybe this is a follow-up PR and not a blocker for this one.

808,"Looking good! And approving! I made one more comment about a const, and also noticed this little issue, which could be tackled in a separate PR or this one (since the issue is ALMOST fixed by this PR):  As you can barely see in this GIF, when changing tabs, the loading state looks great, but goes higher up very briefly because the row containing the tabs very briefly disappears from the layout when switching tabs. If that disappearance can be solved, so it just changes without ""blinking"" we should be in awesome shape! Again, maybe this is a follow-up PR and not a blocker for this one.

Imagine SQL: ``` SELECT case            when gender = 'boy' then True            else False        end AS boolean_gender,        count(num) AS ""COUNT(num)"" FROM birth_names WHERE case           when gender = 'boy' then True           else False       end IN ('false') GROUP BY case              when gender = 'boy' then True              else False          end ORDER BY ""COUNT(num)"" DESC LIMIT 10000; ```  the derived column(Calculated column in Superset) type is Boolean, and the operand is String('true')  ``` case     when gender = 'boy' then True     else False end IN ('false') ```   This PR introduced a conversion when the column type is boolean and operand type also is boolean.   ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable -->  #### Before  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/128458491-8c8d4e31-efb7-4445-9e2f-7ac50d246b42.mov   ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

Imagine SQL: ``` SELECT case            when gender = 'boy' then True            else False        end AS boolean_gender,        count(num) AS ""COUNT(num)"" FROM birth_names WHERE case           when gender = 'boy' then True           else False       end IN ('false') GROUP BY case              when gender = 'boy' then True              else False          end ORDER BY ""COUNT(num)"" DESC LIMIT 10000; ```  the derived column(Calculated column in Superset) type is Boolean, and the operand is String('true')  ``` case     when gender = 'boy' then True     else False end IN ('false') ```   This PR introduced a conversion when the column type is boolean and operand type also is boolean.   ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable -->  #### Before  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/128458491-8c8d4e31-efb7-4445-9e2f-7ac50d246b42.mov   ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? --> 1. select `birth_names` dataset 2. create a new Calculated Columns.  name: boolean_gender SQL expression : `case when gender = 'boy' then True else False end` Data Type: Boolean 3. create a treemap v2. select `boolean_gender` into Group by control; select sum(num) into Metric; check `emit dashboard cross filters`; saved to new dashboard `test` 4. create a table. select `boolean_gender` into Group by control; select sum(num) into Metric; check `emit dashboard cross filters`; saved to dashboard `test` 5. goto dashboard `test` 6. select `true` or `false` in treemap v2, then the table can be filtered. 7. double-check view query in table viz, where clause like below: ``` WHERE case           when gender = 'boy' then True           else False       end IN (false) ```  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16081 - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  ",-1

836,"### SUMMARY This PR adjusts who can see the new dashboard and chart subscribe Icon. Previously it was based on who can add a report, but now it is based on if you have access to alerts and reports in the settings menu.   While looking through this, I noticed that a limited/gamma user does have permissions to add, view, and has menu access to Alerts and Reports.

Previously it was based on who can add a report, but now it is based on if you have access to alerts and reports in the settings menu.   While looking through this, I noticed that a limited/gamma user does have permissions to add, view, and has menu access to Alerts and Reports. Maybe this is an oversight and we need to adjust the permissions for Gamma users?   ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF Admin User:  ![Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11 27 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/128534395-882a3b06-1483-47c9-890b-db6f42ec6ef5.png) Gamma:  ![Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11 27 57 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/128534494-f57fdf8e-c9eb-42a0-87d8-4e6a6d32b907.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

However, when user hovers with their mouse outside of the popover before saving, the title gets reset. Then, after saving, the label appears to be correct, but an empty string gets passed to executed query as a label, causing seemingly unrelated errors. This PR converts `MetricsControl` component from class to functional and uses memoization to prevent resetting the title.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF Before: see linked issue and video in the comments After: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129045681-e33f2ab4-4aac-4d95-b928-6f5c3705e13f.mov  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS 1.

1151,rate value totals in pivot table not work as in table.May it be changed in the future? thanks ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41682019/134639297-33e097c0-b48c-4d17-997b-9a28e247109a.png)  ,1
1152,"Yes, I agree totally with you @Kingflyinger, the ""Totals"" should use the same aggregation logic as the cell values. This has come up a few times but didn't yet get addressed, and requires some additional logic in the query layer that might take some time to implement (we have to issue a separate query for each layer of totals/subtotals). Do you mind opening an issue here so we can get it prioritized and assigned when the right time comes along? ",1

1158,"Yes, I agree totally with you @Kingflyinger, the ""Totals"" should use the same aggregation logic as the cell values. This has come up a few times but didn't yet get addressed, and requires some additional logic in the query layer that might take some time to implement (we have to issue a separate query for each layer of totals/subtotals). Do you mind opening an issue here so we can get it prioritized and assigned when the right time comes along? ",1

Shillelagh can connect directly to any Socrata dataset by using its API URL. Here's an example showing the [percentage of adults partially vaccinated for COVID-19 in the US](https://data.cdc.gov/resource/unsk-b7fc):  ![Screen Shot 2021-08-24 at 8 13 40 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130642774-f52ffce5-660f-4d92-8f5c-b5c71b864f24.png)   ```sql % shillelagh sql> SELECT date, administered_dose1_recip_4 FROM ""https://data.cdc.gov/resource/unsk-b7fc.json"" WHERE location='US' LIMIT 5; date          administered_dose1_recip_4 ----------  ---------------------------- 2021-08-23                          73.1 2021-08-22                          73 2021-08-21                          72.9 2021-08-20                          72.7 2021-08-19                          72.5 sql> ```  We can also create a dataset in Superset and make a time series:  ![Screenshot 2021-08-23 at 21-21-45  DEV  % adults partially vaccinated US](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130555300-d7a5e0ff-d029-47a7-b0a1-cac75acf4573.png)  #### WeatherAPI  This adapter offers access to historical weather data from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). It requires signing up and an API key, but there's a free account.  Here's an example chart showing the perceived temperature in Fahrenheit in Bodega Bay:  ```sql % shillelagh sql> SELECT AVG(feelslike_f) AS ""AVG(feelslike_f)"" FROM ""https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/history.json?q=94923"" LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 0;   AVG(feelslike_f) ------------------            57.6054 sql> ```  ![Screenshot 2021-08-24 at 08-40-19  DEV  Explore - https api weatherapi com v1 history json q=94923](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130647161-a167fc13-465d-4bbf-aaf4-ca3948bfadbe.png)   ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable -->  N/A  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->  Shillelagh supports two dialects, `shillelagh://` and `shillelagh+safe://`. The former is disabled in Superset if `PREVENT_UNSAFE_DB_CONNECTIONS` is true, since it can read and write to disk. The latter allows only safe adapters to be loaded, and they have to be listed explicitly:  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130652237-3629a1ff-de4d-4fff-9bbc-d4ddecf253c8.png"" width=""60%"" />  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130651792-e43e5f10-a28f-49fd-a9ef-eade3728c7d1.png"" width=""60%"" style=""box-shadow:5px 5px 5px #999;"" />  An API key is needed for WeatherAPI:  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130651768-71c4cafd-54f8-4d36-984b-09c14612c863.png"" width=""60%"" />  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with ""x"" --> <!--- HINT: Include ""Fixes #nnn"" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [ ] Has associated issue: - [ ] Required feature flags: - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  ",-1

Here's an example showing the [percentage of adults partially vaccinated for COVID-19 in the US](https://data.cdc.gov/resource/unsk-b7fc):  ![Screen Shot 2021-08-24 at 8 13 40 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130642774-f52ffce5-660f-4d92-8f5c-b5c71b864f24.png)   ```sql % shillelagh sql> SELECT date, administered_dose1_recip_4 FROM ""https://data.cdc.gov/resource/unsk-b7fc.json"" WHERE location='US' LIMIT 5; date          administered_dose1_recip_4 ----------  ---------------------------- 2021-08-23                          73.1 2021-08-22                          73 2021-08-21                          72.9 2021-08-20                          72.7 2021-08-19                          72.5 sql> ```  We can also create a dataset in Superset and make a time series:  ![Screenshot 2021-08-23 at 21-21-45  DEV  % adults partially vaccinated US](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130555300-d7a5e0ff-d029-47a7-b0a1-cac75acf4573.png)  #### WeatherAPI  This adapter offers access to historical weather data from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). It requires signing up and an API key, but there's a free account.  Here's an example chart showing the perceived temperature in Fahrenheit in Bodega Bay:  ```sql % shillelagh sql> SELECT AVG(feelslike_f) AS ""AVG(feelslike_f)"" FROM ""https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/history.json?q=94923"" LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 0;   AVG(feelslike_f) ------------------            57.6054 sql> ```  ![Screenshot 2021-08-24 at 08-40-19  DEV  Explore - https api weatherapi com v1 history json q=94923](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/130647161-a167fc13-465d-4bbf-aaf4-ca3948bfadbe.png)   ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable -->  N/A  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

1224,I just experienced this bug on a preset instance. Was randomly drag and dropping dashboard components. Seemed to occur when I used a combination of tabs and markdown components. ,-1

1259,"### SUMMARY During migration of the Value filter to the new Select component, support for non-string based filter values (`number`, `boolean` and `null`) stopped working correctly. This fixes that  Known limitations: Even with this fix `null` values won't be supported in single select mode. This is due to how the native filter framework interprets the special case of a filter value being unset when the value is `null` (in the ""multiple select"" mode the filter value is `[null]` which is interpreted as being set). We have a potential fix for this, but it will require a slightly bigger refactor to be fully supported.  TODO: update type declarations on `superset-ui` to get rid of the `@ts-ignore`s.  Dashboard with filters unset: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130928197-f49cb965-759d-41ad-8029-80ceb28edf33.png)  ### AFTER ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927234-d7d6ef39-58c9-4c0b-b1a9-2a38faf31160.png) The query is now correctly issuing an `IS NULL` where clause: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927964-ec05d849-c0ff-499c-9c1d-517f000e92e9.png)  Now the values are also formatted correctly ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927337-836054e3-4a80-4d7e-a073-a5a40dc9869a.png)  ### BEFORE Notice how `null` is interpreted as `false`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927537-00f3d132-ae16-40c0-85b1-0efc5242a9aa.png) Same in the query: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927612-3ef04039-56e9-499b-92e8-3486577b46f1.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

1263,"### SUMMARY During migration of the Value filter to the new Select component, support for non-string based filter values (`number`, `boolean` and `null`) stopped working correctly. This fixes that  Known limitations: Even with this fix `null` values won't be supported in single select mode. This is due to how the native filter framework interprets the special case of a filter value being unset when the value is `null` (in the ""multiple select"" mode the filter value is `[null]` which is interpreted as being set). We have a potential fix for this, but it will require a slightly bigger refactor to be fully supported.  TODO: update type declarations on `superset-ui` to get rid of the `@ts-ignore`s.  Dashboard with filters unset: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130928197-f49cb965-759d-41ad-8029-80ceb28edf33.png)  ### AFTER ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927234-d7d6ef39-58c9-4c0b-b1a9-2a38faf31160.png) The query is now correctly issuing an `IS NULL` where clause: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927964-ec05d849-c0ff-499c-9c1d-517f000e92e9.png)  Now the values are also formatted correctly ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927337-836054e3-4a80-4d7e-a073-a5a40dc9869a.png)  ### BEFORE Notice how `null` is interpreted as `false`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927537-00f3d132-ae16-40c0-85b1-0efc5242a9aa.png) Same in the query: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130927612-3ef04039-56e9-499b-92e8-3486577b46f1.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

1330,"When creating a chart and adding multiple ""custom SQL"" metrics, the frontend seems to truncate them to generate the label. If this truncated label is not unique, then only one of the several metrics will be displayed.  I frequently create multiple metrics like: ```sql SUM(vaccinations) FILTER (WHERE agegroup<=17) SUM(vaccinations) FILTER (WHERE agegroup BETWEEN 18 AND 39) SUM(vaccinations) FILTER (WHERE agegroup BETWEEN 40 AND 59) SUM(vaccinations) FILTER (WHERE agegroup>=60) ``` All of these will have the same generated label `SUM(vaccinations) FILTER (WHERE agegroup...`  ### Workaround  Manually adding distinct labels solves this issue. That's a good idea in any case, but a bit extra work when prototyping.  ### Expected results  If I add multiple metrics, I want to see multiple metrics in the resulting graph.  ### Actual results  Only one of many metrics is displayed.  #### Screenshots  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137616/131665196-b834d0c6-0180-4717-b474-d489da7ffece.png)  #### How to reproduce the bug  1. Create new chart. 2. Add multiple ""custom SQL"" metrics with identical first 40 characters. 3.

1331,"I tried to fix this myself, but could not identify the part of code where this ""deduplication"" of metrics happens.  It seems it's in the frontend somewhere, since only one metric is in the ""chart data"" request.  If someone has pointers, I'll gladly try to fix it myself and open a PR.  ",1
1332,"Thanks for flagging @intgr! Tested and reproduced, so this is indeed a bug/regression. I chcked that the request is using untruncated labels, so truncation is happening in the backend. Let me dig where this is happening so you can see if you want to take a stab at fixing it. ",1

So the appearance should be unchanged like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131677214-3847524a-e87d-4d55-aa49-ae4ad260b3a4.png)  with the label value being untruncated (currently this widens very uglily when exceeding 43 chars): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131677024-eb28aae7-649c-40e1-aefa-19c26c62d32d.png)  ",-1

Run  ### Environment  (please complete the following information):  - superset version: 0.0.0dev; git hash 80c39daa85c9be9e66a2e3cf2c9e2a8e5a74a8d6 - python version: 3.9.6 - node.js version: 16.8.0 - any feature flags active: (no, using default config)  ### Checklist  Make sure to follow these steps before submitting your issue - thank you!  - [x] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any. - [x] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. - [x] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.  ",1
1342,"I tried to fix this myself, but could not identify the part of code where this ""deduplication"" of metrics happens.  It seems it's in the frontend somewhere, since only one metric is in the ""chart data"" request.  If someone has pointers, I'll gladly try to fix it myself and open a PR.  ",1
1343,"Thanks for flagging @intgr! Tested and reproduced, so this is indeed a bug/regression. I chcked that the request is using untruncated labels, so truncation is happening in the backend. Let me dig where this is happening so you can see if you want to take a stab at fixing it. ",1
1344,I take that back: the label is incorrectly set by the metric popover:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131675679-258ff2fc-a411-42dd-9e79-9b69bbf30f86.png)  ,1
1345,"This is happening here: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/80c39daa85c9be9e66a2e3cf2c9e2a8e5a74a8d6/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/FilterControl/AdhocFilter/index.js#L182  The correct behavior should be to not physically truncate the label, but to visually handle the overflow with ellipsis. So the appearance should be unchanged like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131677214-3847524a-e87d-4d55-aa49-ae4ad260b3a4.png)  with the label value being untruncated (currently this widens very uglily when exceeding 43 chars): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131677024-eb28aae7-649c-40e1-aefa-19c26c62d32d.png)  ",-1
1346,"Ah, I saw that truncation code, but I assumed that was intentional and the fix should be done somewhere else.  I'll give it a shot, thanks. ",-1
1347,"FYI @intgr, I know @geido has done some great related work, so you can check his PRs or potentially reach out to him for guidance. ",1
1348,"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions. For admin, please label this issue `.pinned` to prevent stale bot from closing the issue.  ",-1
1349,"This issue should not be closed by the stale bot, in my eyes. ",-1
1350,"Wondering if anyone really wants to keep this open for two reasons: 1) It's again been roughly a year since the last comment 2) I/we haven't heard any outcry about this being a major problem 3) It's right on the line between a bug and a feature request.  I'm going to just close it as stale, but we can re-open if anyone feels strongly Â¯\\\_(ãƒ?_/Â¯  ",-1

It's much more likely to want to force a non-dttm to dttm than vice versa.  CI seems to be so flaky we still have some time to iterate.. :D   I wonder if this would be the best flow: If the column exists and the raw datatype has changed, reinfer `is_dttm`. Therefore, if the raw datatype is unchanged, `is_dttm` is also unchanged.  This would have the drawback of disabling `is_dttm` when `VARCHAR(10)` is changed to `VARCHAR(11)` or `TEXT` or some other non-temporal type, but I assume this is fairly uncommon. ",-1

1455,"> I was more thinking of when some column changed from a datetime type to non datetime, the previously inferred is_dttm will be retained. But like I said, I think this case is also OK. It's much more likely to want to force a non-dttm to dttm than vice versa.  CI seems to be so flaky we still have some time to iterate.. :D   I wonder if this would be the best flow: If the column exists and the raw datatype has changed, reinfer `is_dttm`. Therefore, if the raw datatype is unchanged, `is_dttm` is also unchanged.  This would have the drawback of disabling `is_dttm` when `VARCHAR(10)` is changed to `VARCHAR(11)` or `TEXT` or some other non-temporal type, but I assume this is fairly uncommon. ",-1

1502,"### SUMMARY The PR #16183 that updated some examples dashboard metadata contained a bug where a row component name was changed from `ROW-zhOlQLQnB` to `ROW-dieUdkeUw`, but its id was made equal to another row component (`ROW-xSeNAspgw` instead of its own name defined on line 240). This clashing id caused deleting rows/components on the dashboard to break.  ### SCREENSHOT ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/135818666-226ca7b9-4277-4754-ac8a-a02cfcd9b539.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS  1.

1505,"### SUMMARY The PR #16183 that updated some examples dashboard metadata contained a bug where a row component name was changed from `ROW-zhOlQLQnB` to `ROW-dieUdkeUw`, but its id was made equal to another row component (`ROW-xSeNAspgw` instead of its own name defined on line 240). This clashing id caused deleting rows/components on the dashboard to break.  ### SCREENSHOT ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/135818666-226ca7b9-4277-4754-ac8a-a02cfcd9b539.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS  1.

2103,"When user selects ""Numerical range"" native filter, only numeric columns should be available to choose.

When user has selected a non-numeric column and then changes filter type to numerical range, the column field should be reset.",0
2104,"We use `type_generic` field to check column's type. If a column doesn't have `type_generic` field, we assume that it's numeric as a failsafe.",-1

2847,"@kicaak Thank you for your examples. I like the idea of opening the filter hierarchy in the filter bar. After all, the user is just setting filter values just like he does when interacting with non-hierarchical filters. The modal approach has problems especially when we have the scroll bar enabled and the filter that the user is currently editing disappears from the viewport. I also think that it's way easier for the user to edit some value in the middle of the hierarchy because currently, only one level is present in the filter bar. If we are going this way, I think we need a more clear distinction of the hierarchy group when it's expanded. Maybe a blue background color or a highlight border or other fancy way.",-1

2856,"Regarding this one - I think that parent filter should always be displayed when the hierarchy is collapsed, because otherwise it is hard to follow what happens. We can add a label or other indicator so the user knows that there are fields that are empty. cc: @junlincc what do you think? ",-1
2857,> I think we need a more clear distinction of the hierarchy group when it's expanded. Maybe a blue background color or a highlight border or other fancy way.,0
2858,"Agreed, for now I added a divider, but I think it won't work in the long run. The only reasonable solution here is background colour when hierarchy is expanded, but I would not like to use the blueish preset's colour (even if ligter version) as this one should be for special actions/components. Grey may blend with the dashboard, but I will see what else I can do. Also additional thing would be setting up a rule that only one group can be expanded at a time which would help I think. ",1

3491,### SUMMARY,0
3492,"In `DashboardContainer` we recalculated `chartsInScope` only when scopes changed. However, when we deleted a filter and added a new one with the same scope, scopes were equal so we didn't calculate chartsInScope for the new filter. That resulted in `undefined` error. This PR adds filter's ID to scopes so that we sync `chartsInScope` when scopes change and when new filters are created",-1

3730,### SUMMARY,0
3731,"Historically we've seen records in our database where the Dashboard JSON metadata had `""show_native_filters"": true` even though we never enabled the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature. This was problematic as both native and legacy filters were then present resulting in incorrect behavior when filters were cleared.",-1
3732,It seemed prudent that the default adheres to the feature flag setting rather than being set to `true`.,-1

4388,"@simcha90 The bug was reported to occur when ""Apply to all panels"" scope is selected. When you create a new filter, ""Apply to specific panels"" with charts from different datasets deselected is the default, which means that in the attached video you run your tests with the charts that don't match deselected. However, this is an old issue. I would argue that it's no longer relevant, since we deselect charts that use different datasets by default. Selecting ""Apply to all panels"" is a conscious decision of the user. There are some cases when we want to apply a filter based on some dataset  to charts that use different dataset - that's why I didn't exclude those charts when using ""Apply to all panels"". See https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15302.",-1

4979,### SUMMARY,0
4980,This will be one of the many PRs to address perf issues raised in #15518 .,0
4981,"Currently the Dashboard page will wait for both `datasets` and `charts` data to start rendering, however the datasets data are only used in filter indicators and filter boxes and should not block us from rendering other charts. In our case, the `datasets` endpoint is often much slower because we have a giant single-source-of-truth datasource with thousands of metrics and columns.",-1
4982,"Unblocking rendering from the datasets endpoint should speed up the page rendering a little bit. In our use case, it's often a matter of a full second.",0
4983,It's not easy to simply remove `datasources` from Dashboard state as that would involve letting the filter indicators and filter box fetching datasource metadata themselves.,0

5535,### SUMMARY,0
5536,This PR fixes native filter metadata in versioned import/export of dashboards by doing the following:,0
5537,#NAME?,0
5538,"- replaces `datasetId` with `datasetUuid` in native filter targets to ensure that dataset reference is based on UUID, not numeric id.",0
5539,Other bycatch fixes that were found while testing:,0
5540,"- Fix datatype of `query_context` in `ImportV1ChartSchema`, which should be `String`, not `Dict` (caused a marshmallow schema validation exception). Also make it accept `None` values and add JSON validation.",1
5541,"- `datasource_type` in `dataset_info` was set as `view` if the table was a virtual table, which caused an exception when importing virtual datasets. Since virtual datasets are in fact regular `table` datasources, we just reference the `datasource_type` of the imported dataset.",0
5542,### SCREENSHOT,0
5543,Now native filter targets are referencing `datasetUuid` instead of `datasetId`:,0

5545,### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS,0
5546,"1. enable the ""VERSIONED_EXPORT"" feature flag",0
5547,"2. export a dashboard that had only one chart and two native filters, one referencing the same dataset as the chart and another not referenced by the chart",0
5548,3. check that the native filter configurations in the dashboard metadata contain `datasetUuid` instead of `datasetId` references,0
5549,"4. delete the exported dashboard, chart and dataset only referenced by the native filter",0
5550,5. import the exported bundle,0
5551,"6. make sure the imported dashboard works correctly, and that both datasets are imported correctly and native filter configurations are correct",0

5623,### SUMMARY,0
5624,"This PR adds a new conditional formatting type to the pivot table viz that automatically infers the lower and upper bounds of the color scale. In addition a db migration migrates heatmap coloring from the previous version of the Pivot Table V2 chart to the new conditional formatting control. This is done by applying conditional formatting on all metrics with red scale using the new `None` operator (infer cutoff and extreme value from cell values).

6350,### SUMMARY,0
6351,This pr fixes an issue where user would view charts and run queries without saving but the api would return that user had modified the chart. This was caused because of a change in the api using query_context where accessing the slice table would do an automatic saved changed_on_delta_humanize. This pr add two new cols to the Slice table so that the user only see's actually modified charts.,1

6489,@john-bodley I added a change where the **first time** the user views a saved chart it does a `PUT` request storing the associated `query_context` in a new column (`slices.query_context`). This is needed because:,1
6490,"1. To get the data for a given chart, we need to `POST` the `query_context` to `/api/v1/chart/`.",0
6491,2. To obtain `query_context` from `form_data` we need to run Javascript code unique to each visualization.,0
6492,"This means that, programmatically, **it was impossible to get the data for a given saved chart**, something we needed for reports.",1
6493,"We can't populate the new column `slices.query_context` with the migration script that added, since it requires Javascript code, so the charts now check to see if the column is null, and if so, they will do the `PUT` request to populate the column.",0
6494,"The side-effect of this is that charts are being shown as modified, even if they're not. The problem here is that the `changed_on` column is auto-populated by FAB every time the model changes, and we can't control that from Superset (please correct me if I'm wrong). Which is why @pkdotson added a custom column to track actual modifications by the user, and not by background processes.",1
6495,"Personally I don't see this as an anti-pattern. FAB offers a column `changed_on` for convenience, and if we need finer control I think it's ok to add a new column and track the updates ourselves. This has the potential to be useful for other use cases in the future, like migrations that modify the chart data.",1

7397,"To be clear the longer term vision is to give more room to the ""Powered by Apache Superset"" under a sub menu in the Preset logo (top-left), with a nice biggish Superset logo.  This along with more resources in a large sub-menu. This has not been fully designed yet, but ideas included things like a ""preset workspace picker"", ""invite friends!"" and other actions",1

9395,"When user added an adhoc metric, then opened a popover to edit that metric and clicked ""Save"" without doing any changes, the metric label would disappear. This PR adds a check if old and edited metric are equal - if they are, no actions are taken.",0
9396,"Basically what happened was that when we saved a metric without any changes, we didn't call `coerceAdhocMetrics` (which converts an object to AdhocMetric), but we did call `onChange`. The result was that we passed a normal object instead of AdhocMetric instance to value renderer, and in value renderer we checked for instanceof AdhocMetric",-1

9568,### SUMMARY,0
9569,"When user opened ""Add new metric"" popover and selected a column and/or aggregate, metric title is automatically set to ""column(aggregate)"". However, when user hovers with their mouse outside of the popover before saving, the title gets reset. Then, after saving, the label appears to be correct, but an empty string gets passed to executed query as a label, causing seemingly unrelated errors.",-1
9570,This PR converts `MetricsControl` component from class to functional and uses memoization to prevent resetting the title.,0

10759,"Yes, I agree totally with you @Kingflyinger, the ""Totals"" should use the same aggregation logic as the cell values. This has come up a few times but didn't yet get addressed, and requires some additional logic in the query layer that might take some time to implement (we have to issue a separate query for each layer of totals/subtotals). Do you mind opening an issue here so we can get it prioritized and assigned when the right time comes along?",1

10777,This PR fixes many cases when applying the pivot table post-processing.,0
10778,"I reimplemented the algorithm from scratch to make sure it matches the JS logic, testing as many combinations as I could and comparing the Python results with the JS visualization.",0
10779,For each of those cases I added a unit test showing the pivot. The resulting table in each of the unit tests matches the table from the visualization.,0

11717,### SUMMARY,0
11718,"During migration of the Value filter to the new Select component, support for non-string based filter values (`number`, `boolean` and `null`) stopped working correctly. This fixes that",1
11719,"Known limitations: Even with this fix `null` values won't be supported in single select mode. This is due to how the native filter framework interprets the special case of a filter value being unset when the value is `null` (in the ""multiple select"" mode the filter value is `[null]` which is interpreted as being set). We have a potential fix for this, but it will require a slightly bigger refactor to be fully supported.",1

12409,"When creating a chart and adding multiple ""custom SQL"" metrics, the frontend seems to truncate them to generate the label. If this truncated label is not unique, then only one of the several metrics will be displayed.",0

This is due all temporal filters being encoded as `datetime.datetime` objects, irrespective of the target column being `DATE`, `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` (we handle formatting of the temporal value in `BaseEngineSpec.convert_dttm`). This error is due to the SqlAlchemy `Date` and `Datetime` column types not being able to handle `datetime` and `date` objects respectively.",1

13192,"Every time control state is updated on the Explore view, the data panel requests new data, even when the changes are known not to affect the chart data (`renderTrigger` property set to `true`). This PR changes `ExploreChartPanel` to only refresh the `queryFormData` that's used by `DataTablesPane` if the `triggerRender` prop is not `true` (is falsy when a query has been issued). This only happens when the chart needs to be rerendered without rerequesting data.",1

14257,It seems like the issue comes from the Presto engine spec mapping Dates to Datetime in sqlalchemy ([see this line](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L511)) while the `convert_dttm` does not support DATETIME ([see here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L746)). ,1
