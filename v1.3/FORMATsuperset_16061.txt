/testenv up FEATURE_DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS=true  
@villebro Ephemeral environment spinning up at http://52.12.11.95:8080. Credentials are `admin`/`admin`. Please allow several minutes for bootstrapping and startup. 
FYI QA team: I created a dashboard for testing with the following dataset:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128206350-131c941b-7204-4786-a0ba-826c9a3fe5eb.png)  I had to manually change it to BOOLEAN type because SQLite doesn't natively support booleans (with postgres this works correctly like in my description screenshots), but it's enough to fool the Superset UI into thinking the `bool` column is actually a boolean column (See the "T/F" icon next to the bool column)":  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128206680-6cf17c67-5315-422a-aefc-169f9fdb144f.png)  And finally the dashboard, where it shows up:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128206786-197bef8a-7b90-49c9-9c95-49b9ef0ac94f.png)  
@villebro Thank you so much for creating the dashboard for QA test, I verified the selection for boolean column in value filter and everything works well for me. I found a issue that the default value is not stay if user remove or change the filter value on dashboard, I am expecting the default value will show when I refresh the page. But I think that is not related to your change I will file separate issue for it.  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597121/128231646-1dd1d44c-26f9-4e6a-aefa-f2b151d98284.mov   
Thanks for confirming @jinghua-qa ! I can check that bug - can you open a ticket for it?
