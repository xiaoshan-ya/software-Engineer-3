### SUMMARY When user added an adhoc metric, then opened a popover to edit that metric and clicked "Save" without doing any changes, the metric label would disappear. This PR adds a check if old and edited metric are equal - if they are, no actions are taken.  Basically what happened was that when we saved a metric without any changes, we didn't call `coerceAdhocMetrics` (which converts an object to AdhocMetric), but we did call `onChange`. The result was that we passed a normal object instead of AdhocMetric instance to value renderer, and in value renderer we checked for instanceof AdhocMetric  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF Before: see linked issue After: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129003100-1701671f-b658-49ad-bb2e-3ed13c0e5207.mov  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS 0. Enable dnd 1. Create a chart and add an adhoc metric 2. Open a popover to edit that metric and click save without doing any changes 3. The metric label should stay as it was, no changes should happen  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with "x" --> <!--- HINT: Include "Fixes #nnn" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [x] Has associated issue: fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16184 - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  CC @jinghua-qa @junlincc
