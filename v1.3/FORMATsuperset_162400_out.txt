This PR removes the tag for Timeseries Table in two spots - in the repo (why is this even here?) and in the superset-ui plugin (why is this not the one we're using?). It also removes it from the relevant part of the ECharts plugin.  Brings in the 0.17.83 release for [this change](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1306/files).  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF <!--- Skip this if not applicable --> **Before:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/129265241-2ef0b672-53de-4c78-8657-30e6401204eb.png)  **After:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/129264764-1990800e-d684-45ca-8ac5-49e57671ff12.png)   ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!
