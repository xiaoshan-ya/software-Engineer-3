2	-2	When upgrading from 1.1 to 1.3, dashboards that use Native filter are unusable. <img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2021-08-24 at 9 43 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8875448/130755284-59c16af7-96f6-4bd4-96c2-48c0fb7eaf68.png">  On clicking see more: <img width="592" alt="Native filters 1 1 to 1 3 upgrade" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8875448/130755097-5c4a3f8f-97ec-494e-9ad0-f63b46e3eecc.png">  ### Expected results The upgrade should not disrupt the filters.  ### Environment  (please complete the following information):  - superset version: `1.3` - python version: `3.9` - installed via pip install.  
3	-1	Thanks for reporting @stevensuting ! We will look what it would take to fix this for 1.3.1! 
1	-2	@stevensuting I'm looking for minimal reproduction steps for this bug. Does this sound accurate? - Spin up a 1.1 version of Superset - Create a select filter on a dashboard - Upgrade to 1.3 - Go into dashboard that was created with 1.1 - See error message  
1	-1	@villebro @jinghua-qa i think we should test version upgrade to make sure not only the new version works, but also a smooth upgrade from an older version.  
2	-1	I can confirmed that #16468 fixes this (falls back to defaults for filter-specific control values):  ### BEFORE ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131338549-94608e9b-4701-45a2-91ab-b22f34282567.png)  ### AFTER ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/131338609-5653b3a2-353a-468a-8c79-f61f802d5aff.png)
