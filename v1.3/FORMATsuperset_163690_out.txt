As the backend expects key-value pairs, the requests were failing due to the request being sent as an array instead of an object.  ### AFTER When changing a table reference in the dataset modal, the metadata now updates correctly: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130199901-bfb2051b-90b7-4557-91c8-91288148193b.png)  ### BEFORE Previously the marshmallow load failed due to deserialization being performed with a list of values, rather than a dict of key-value pairs: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/130200006-47941459-8aa6-4d1f-b525-7dffcc8761bd.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!
