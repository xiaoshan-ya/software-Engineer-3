Previously it was based on who can add a report, but now it is based on if you have access to alerts and reports in the settings menu.   While looking through this, I noticed that a limited/gamma user does have permissions to add, view, and has menu access to Alerts and Reports. Maybe this is an oversight and we need to adjust the permissions for Gamma users?   ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF Admin User:  ![Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11 27 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/128534395-882a3b06-1483-47c9-890b-db6f42ec6ef5.png) Gamma:  ![Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11 27 57 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/128534494-f57fdf8e-c9eb-42a0-87d8-4e6a6d32b907.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!
