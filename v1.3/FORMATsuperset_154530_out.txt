2	-2	In 1.3 branch, when you click on "Export Dashboard", the app loads interminably and never downloads the JSON.  This functionality worked in 1.2.  It's worth noting that 1.3 has an additional parameter with the endpoint it is hitting (`token`), that was not there in previous versions.  Also, if you hit the API endpoint directly, e.g., `http://<domain_name>.com/api/v1/dashboard/export/?q=[6,7]`, exports work as expected.  ### Expected results  The dashboard should be downloaded almost instantaneously as a JSON.  ### Actual results  The app has the loading icon interminably and never downloads.

Go to https://<domain>/dashboard/list/ 2. Create dashboard 3. Click on export 4. Watch it load interminably :(  (Issue also exists on dashboards with charts in them and the like, but wanted to make sure it wasn't my dashboard that was the issue.)  ### Environment  - superset version: 1.3 branch - python version: Python 3.7.9 - node.js version: 14  ### Checklist  - [ x ] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any. - [ x ] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. - [ x ] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar. 
1	-1	hi @vermilioncity ,  Did you toggle on the VERSIONED_EXPORT feature_flag? 
3	-2	We hadn't!  We toggled it, and it does successfully download the JSON now.  However, the forever-loading icon remains, so there is a cosmetic bug. 
1	-1	Actually, update on this.  It helps if we use the same dashboard for testing ;).   The forever-loading-but-downloads happens with dashboards that use a physical dataset.  If using a virtual dataset, it forever-loads-and-also-doesn't-download. 
3	-1	Nm, we didn't set the flag correctly, it looks like.  All good here!  This can be closed :P
