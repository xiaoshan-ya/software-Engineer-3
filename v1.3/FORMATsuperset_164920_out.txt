Go to /databaseview/list/ 2. Open developer console 2. Click on + Database 4. See error  ### Environment  (please complete the following information):  - superset version: 1.3.0 - python version: 3.8.11 - node.js version: 14 - any feature flags active:  N/A - sqlalchemy-clickhouse==0.1.5.post0 - infi.clickhouse-orm==1.0.2   ### Checklist  Make sure to follow these steps before submitting your issue - thank you!  - [X] I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any. - [X] I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset. - [X] I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.  ### Quickfix  After removing the following libs, the +Database continues to work. However, superset 1.2.0 used to work with the same libs just fine. - sqlalchemy-clickhouse==0.1.5.post0 - infi.clickhouse-orm==1.0.2  
1	-1	Have you tried `clickhouse-sqlalchemy` You seem to be running `sqlalchemy-clickhouse` which some have said to not work as well, so switching the connector might help. 
1	-2	I can confirm that uninstalling `sqlalchemy-clickhouse` and installing `clickhouse-sqlalchemy` disappears the reported UI error. Tried on ubuntu 20.04. Here are the steps ``` pip3 uninstall sqlalchemy-clickhouse pip3 install wheel. # if you get error on setup.py and not able to bdist_wheel ~ish pip3 install clickhouse-sqlalchemy ``` 
2	-1	Thanks for confirming - closing 
3	-1	Thanks!
