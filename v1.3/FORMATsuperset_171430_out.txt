Install 1.3.1 2. Sync column tables in Superset for a table that has a DATE column 3. Check the Superset type of the column, should be DATETIME  ### Expected results  Querying a Presto table with a time range should work.   ### Actual results  This will prevent Superset from query the table with time constraints. The query will return `Cannot apply operator: date >= varchar(26)` error. When looking at the generated query, temporal predicates do not get included in date conversion function, i.e.:  ``` WHERE "eventdate" >= '2021-09-18 00:00:00.000000'   AND "eventdate" < '2021-10-18 12:35:33.000000' ``` While it should be - and in prior versions was - :  ``` WHERE "eventdate" >= from_iso8601_date('2021-09-18 00:00:00.000000')   AND "eventdate" < from_iso8601_date('2021-10-18 12:35:33.000000') ```  ### Environment  - superset version: 1.3.1 - Presto version: 343 - pyhive version: 0.6.4 - python version: 3.7   ### Additional context  It seems like the issue comes from the Presto engine spec mapping Dates to Datetime in sqlalchemy ([see this line](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L511)) while the `convert_dttm` does not support DATETIME ([see here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L746)).   Note that with past versions, DATE presto columns mapped to DATE Sqlalchmy columns.

If you want to retain the DATETIME columns, another alternative would be to update the `convert_dttm` function to support DATETIME.    
2	-1	Thanks for catching this @oscarostlundgs. I had not noticed that the Presto spec doesn't support `DATETIME` in `convert_dttm`. Would you be open to opening a PR for that? I'll be happy to help if needed
