3	-2	I set the public user permissions to allow all the permissions I could find. I then got the public link and added "?standalone=true". I am not able to view the dashboard.  ### Expected results  I expect to be able to see the dashboards as a public user with the correct permissions.  ### Actual results  I get a very non-descriptive error or the frontend.  #### Screenshots   ![Screenshot from 2021-09-16 15-17-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65215432/133619233-8ba1985c-e238-4fa3-a6ee-a0f206d0fbd0.png)  #### How to reproduce the bug  1. Use the pre-configured demo charts 2. Add the permissions to the public user 3. Get the public link of the dashboard "https://xxxx/r/1?standalone=true" 4. Logout and visit link. Presented with an error.  ### Environment  (please complete the following information):  Using the docker image: apache/superset:1.3.1rc1 with the helm deploy - superset version: `1.3.1-rc1` - python version: `Python 3.7.9` - node.js version: Cant find node but its the version installed on the image - any feature flags active: The following config overrides were used with the deploy to allow it to run in an iframe and enable some features. ``` configOverrides:    allow_iframe_access: |      HTTP_HEADERS = {'X-Frame-Options': 'ALLOWALL', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', 'X-Forwarded-Proto': 'https'}     ENABLE_PROXY_FIX = True     WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = False   feature_flags: |     FEATURE_FLAGS = {       "DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS": True,       "DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS": True,       "ALERT_REPORTS": True     } ```  ### Additional context This used to work perfectly fine with apache/superset:1.1.0 and now does not seem to.

1	-2	Mine has the same problem and the same error. What can I do to solve this problem? I don't know. Did you handle it 
2	-3	this happens due new report feature in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16027, which tries to fetch saved reports on chart/chart created by logged in user and fails because user is not set if not logged in. I think we should not load any report if its public chart/dashboard. If flag is turned off, it should work for now. 
1	-1	I am also facing this issue. @mayurnewase could you be a little bit more specific. What flag is needed to be turned off? Has anyone managed to fix this? 
1	-1	Turn ALERT_REPORTS off or pull my patch referenced above and try again. 
2	-1	@mayurnewase Thanks for the reply. Turning ALERT_REPORTS off doesn't work in my environment. Will try to pull your patch. 
3	-2	@mayurnewase I have been trying to find a simple solution for this issue. I cant get this to work if disable flag ENABLE_REACT_CRUD_VIEWS and ALERT_REPORTS. But that is not an optimal solution since then the dashboard list looks like this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92523108/145021428-32c6a3e4-c191-4555-bec4-95c96e4ae3ea.png)  Instead of this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92523108/145021711-e03568de-77f9-4aef-9838-730b0b0579d5.png)  I can see that your patch (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17106) has been merged into master. Do you know if it is in release 1.4.0?  
1	-1	This is still an issue in version 1.4.0. Does anyone have an idea what version will include the fix for this. 
2	-2	This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions. For admin, please label this issue `.pinned` to prevent stale bot from closing the issue.  
3	-1	Having public dashboards available would be awesome, however, i think it's partly prevented by #17227 as well 
1	-1	The public, i.e. people not logged in, can view dashboards in version 2.0.0.  I have `DASHBOARD_RBAC` feature flag enabled and the `Public` role assigned under dashboard properties -> Roles.  Because it's mentioned above, I also have `ALERT_REPORTS` flag enabled too.  IMO this can be closed as fixed in 2.0.0. 
1	-1	      This always worked imho, but can others also access the dashboard purely based on the data access permissions?    Especially on a different dashboard, that hasn't assigned any roles access?    That's the part that doesn't work for me.                     >    > Am 23.09.2022 um 15:28, Sam Firke  ***@***.***>  schrieb: >    >    > > The public, i.e. people not logged in, can view dashboards in version 2.0.0.

1	-1	> Can others also access the dashboard purely based on the data access permissions? Especially on a different dashboard, that hasn't assigned any roles access?  Not sure, my use case doesn't do much with data access permissions and I've been assigning the Public role to all public-facing dashboards.
