### SUMMARY This removes some depreciated datasets from the CLI as part of an effort to clean up code and to smoothen the experience that a newer user has.   We have heard feedback from users that these examples are not useful, and that they replicate features that are not useful for every day users. In fact, in many instances these datasets serve to confuse new users.     ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF N/A ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!
