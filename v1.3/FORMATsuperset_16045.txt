### SUMMARY This PR adds a new conditional formatting type to the pivot table viz that automatically infers the lower and upper bounds of the color scale. In addition a db migration migrates heatmap coloring from the previous version of the Pivot Table V2 chart to the new conditional formatting control. This is done by applying conditional formatting on all metrics with red scale using the new `None` operator (infer cutoff and extreme value from cell values). While this does not provide a 1-1 feature mapping to the previous version of the plugin, it's the closest match that is possible to be achieved with the new formatting control.  This PR requires the following `superset-ui` PRs to function properly (in `superset-ui` version `0.17.78` which is now on master): - https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1264 - https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1269  ### BEFORE Before the removal of the heatmap feature, the Pivot Table v2 chart provided six different conditional formatting options; heatmap and bar across all, row and column values: <img width="1713" alt="Screenshot 2021-08-03 at 14 45 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128039411-4b2775a7-2bca-413d-a230-80721b1a0a18.png">  After the introduction of the new conditional formatting feature, those charts lost their coloring: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128040192-7ff27bce-65e6-4a2d-837f-f30b57eae4aa.png)  ### AFTER After the migration the charts will display colored cells again. As can be seen, the bar option has been removed, along with row/column orientations (now formatting is always done per metric). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128161666-07582fcc-4a97-4b6b-b222-53ad4d4dbf34.png)  The new automatic conditional formatting control option, which doesn't have a target value: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128161774-203d80c1-6473-4954-937c-75293f75852d.png)  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS <!--- Required!

Hi @villebro i tested this PR in our sandbox environment. i saw upgrade running correct: ``` INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 31b2a1039d4a -> 143b6f2815da, migrate pivot table v2 heatmaps to new format Upgraded 87 slices. ``` But after that, the chart still not populated a `CUSTOMIZE METRICS` <img width="1196" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-04 at 12 43 15 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/128141902-4f8e47de-7490-4ad1-b6b1-d37c38b929c3.png">  Before the chart is configured to display as this: <img width="1090" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-04 at 12 44 52 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/128142285-c1b6bcf0-2599-4775-b0e6-2dada0cfc8fa.png">   
@graceguo-supercat this PR still needs to bump `superset-ui` (we still don't have the required https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1264 PR in). We're bumping today, after that this should work.
