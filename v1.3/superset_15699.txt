### SUMMARY

This will be one of the many PRs to address perf issues raised in #15518 .

Currently the Dashboard page will wait for both `datasets` and `charts` data to start rendering, however the datasets data are only used in filter indicators and filter boxes and should not block us from rendering other charts. In our case, the `datasets` endpoint is often much slower because we have a giant single-source-of-truth datasource with thousands of metrics and columns.

Unblocking rendering from the datasets endpoint should speed up the page rendering a little bit. In our use case, it's often a matter of a full second.

It's not easy to simply remove `datasources` from Dashboard state as that would involve letting the filter indicators and filter box fetching datasource metadata themselves.

### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF

#### Before

Dashboard renders after `/datasets` is loaded:

#### After

Dashboard renders as soon as `/dashboard/[id]` and `/dashboard/[id]/charts` are loaded:

this is a reasonable trade-off we can try. Is it possible that filter_box started query before dataset metadata is not ready, will that cause any issue?

Time Column and Granularity control in filter boxes may not have select choices. Filter indicators may show inexplicable filter values. But those are expected to be temporary and not very noticeable.

In case datasets loading fails, in previous case, the whole page won't render, while after this change you still have a largely functional Dashboard page.

Have we verified yet that none of the chart plugins use datasets? If so we should also stop passing datasets to the charts.

If any of the plugins do use datasets, this might break them.

Thanks for pointing this out. I did more vetting and realized that some charts do use info on `datasource`, mostly non-critical info such as column name `verboseMap` here: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/61accc6ce9c546331b7407cde21d6ec163fe191d/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-pivot-table/src/transformProps.js

Fixed a re-render issue now that charts will be updated accordingly once datasets are loaded:

Notice the name of the first column. It uses `verbose_map` and updated after `/datasets` is fully loaded. Note that I artificially slowed down the `/datasets` API. For most users, this minor update may not be even noticeable.
