3	-3	Hmmm... something seems amiss, if I'm not mistaken. If I go to the Sales Dashboard, and create a new filter, the default dataset should be "cleaned_sales_data" but the Select now shows "27" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125025036-29931a80-e03f-11eb-9f1f-7c2f5f88baa8.png)  "cleaned_sales_data" doesn't show up in the options list, but I _can_ search for it. When I select it, and create a filter, like so... ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125025125-5ba47c80-e03f-11eb-8d57-0850e9d17ef3.png)  I get this error in the filter bar: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125025158-6828d500-e03f-11eb-8fdc-66f19589e476.png)  However, the value filter DOES seem to work fine in other dashboards... which is confusing. The above issue is happening on the ephemeral env. I'll try it on a local build and see if I get the same results... 
3	-2	Well hmm... on my local build, with the Sales Dashboard, I see the correct data source in the Select. However, I can't create functional native filters (attempted value and numeric range) on that dashboard. I get that "Cannot load filter" error. On other dashboards, things are working seemingly fine. Something is amiss, but I'm not yet sure if it's the data source, the dashboard, or the feature(s). 
2	-2	@rusackas Thanks for testing this. I'll investigate the problem with the Sales Dashboard.

So probably this dataset is corrupted and you can ignore this error.

1	-1	Sure @michael-s-molina . I'll do some manual testing as well today and come back to you. 
3	-2	@geido @rusackas @junlincc   > I have noticed a problem with the creation of new options. It is now allowing for the creation of existing options, which would then make unselecting any of the duplicated options impossible. It gets stuck. >  > I don't see my newly created option "test" in the dropdown in multiple mode >  > I don't see my newly created option in the dropdown in single mode. I think this used to work consistently with the single mode ON and allowNewOptions OFF, where the selected option is highlighted at top of the options list >   After investigation, I discovered that these were not bugs in the new `Select` component but problems in the `SelectFilterPlugin` component.  `SelectFilterPlugin` contained duplicated logic already present in the `Select` component. I removed the duplicated logic.  > I am not sure if this is related to this PR but I am unable to create hierarchical filters. The child filter never appears anywhere. Only the parent is showing up. When I go back to editing, the hierarchical option is always unchecked as if it wasn't saved. >   This was in fact related to this PR. Fixed.  > After adding a new filter, the previously selected options of the existing filters are not selected anymore. This may be because I haven't clicked "Apply", however, as a user I would expect that my filters remain filled as I add or delete other filters, even before applying (I am fine if this needs to be discussed outside of the scope of this PR) >   This one is by design, until now we only keep the values if the user clicks on "Apply". We can change this behavior if the product team agrees but if that's the case we need to open another low priority issue.  @rusackas @geido I also applied all your suggestions.  @geido Thanks for testing the features. I updated the environment and requested your review again.

2	-3	Hey @michael-s-molina. Thanks for the fixes. There's only one problem that I could find. See below  When I choose _Time Grain_ and a default value, it won't allow me to select the option _Original value_. It fails to select it. This happens on both the modal and the left sidebar  <img width="1086" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-20 at 17 12 03" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/126349431-d693af54-2eb5-4884-829d-119b592a617c.png">  <img width="1102" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-20 at 17 24 03" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/126351138-580b12aa-45d0-4f3e-bc7e-bec89ae3d834.png">   
1	-2	@geido This problem is already happening on master so I'll open another PR to fix it so we can merge this one.
