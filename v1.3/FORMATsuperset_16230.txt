### SUMMARY This PR casts  number-like strings to numbers in order to ensure correct value validation in conditional formatting. Before, we were comparing values that were actually strings and not numbers, which caused incorrect validation errors.  I also did some refactoring to avoid unnecessary rerenders.  ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF Before: see linked issue After: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129187281-ab83bcde-870c-4715-a733-9448bdbd9c84.mov  ### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS 1. Open Table or Pivot Table v2 chart 2. Add conditional formatter with "Between" operator and type left and right values. Verify that errors show up only if left value is larger than right. Try typing left value which is alphabetically "larger", but arithmetically smaller than right value in order to recreate the reported issue.  ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!--- Check any relevant boxes with "x" --> <!--- HINT: Include "Fixes #nnn" if you are fixing an existing issue --> - [x] Has associated issue: fixes #16169  - [ ] Changes UI - [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))   - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible   - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested   - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided - [ ] Introduces new feature or API - [ ] Removes existing feature or API  CC @vnnw @junlincc @jinghua-qa
